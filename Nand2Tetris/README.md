# Nand2Tetris

This repository contains my personal solutions and projects based on the [Nand to Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) course, also known as **"The Elements of Computing Systems"**.

The course walks through the journey of building a modern computer system from the ground up, starting with basic logic gates and ending with a full computer running a high-level language.

## ðŸ“š Project Structure

Each numbered folder corresponds to a chapter in the course:

- `01` â€“ Boolean Logic Gates (NAND, AND, OR, NOT, etc.)
- `02` â€“ Building the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)
- `03` â€“ Sequential Logic (Flip-flops, Registers, Counters)
- `04` â€“ Machine Language and HACK Assembler
- `05` â€“ Computer Architecture (CPU, Memory, etc.)
- `06` â€“ Assembler in software
- `07-08` â€“ Virtual Machine I & II (Stack-based VM implementation)
- `09` â€“ High-Level Programming in Jack
- `10` â€“ Compiler: Syntax Analysis
- `11` â€“ Compiler: Code Generation
- `12` â€“ Operating System

## ðŸ›  Tools Used

- **Hardware Simulator** (`.hdl` files)
- **Assembler** (`.asm` programs)
- **VM Emulator**
